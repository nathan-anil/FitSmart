# FitSmart 2021
The average person spends 15 minutes a day choosing their outfit! Not to mention stressing about it the previous day. Well, with FitSmart, planning outfits has never been easier.

**Technologies** <br />
Used native web technologies for the frontend, and Google Firebase for the database. The uploaded images are drawn to an HTML canvas and then converted into a final image with javascript. The database consists of three collections: one that stores the day with the corresponding outfit, one that stores an aggregate of all of the individual images uploaded by the user, and one that stores the final outfit the user created.
A submission for the Hack the Six Hackathon.

**Skills I learned:** <br />
Became better at front-end and back-end development. 
I also learned a lot about DOM manipulation and deploying apps with firebase.
